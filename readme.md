# Tower Defense with Pygame: Multi-Day Build Guide

This version is intentionally split into function-sized and class-sized code blocks.
Students should type each block, test, then continue. Do not hand out one full finished file.

## Teacher Setup

Install pygame once on each machine:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

Run code each day with:

```bash
python3 tower_defense.py
```

Fallback:

```bash
python tower_defense.py
```

## How To Use This Guide In Class

1. Start from yesterday's working file.
2. Add blocks in order.
3. Run after each block.
4. Fix errors before moving on.

Suggested pace for 60 minutes:
- 10 min mini-lesson
- 35 min coding blocks
- 10 min test and debug
- 5 min recap

## Day 1: Window, Constants, and Grid

Checkpoint goal:
- Window opens and a board grid is visible.

Block 1: imports and constants

```python
import sys
import pygame

pygame.init()

GRID_COLS = 16
GRID_ROWS = 12
TILE_SIZE = 56
BOARD_WIDTH = GRID_COLS * TILE_SIZE
BOARD_HEIGHT = GRID_ROWS * TILE_SIZE
PANEL_WIDTH = 280
WIDTH = BOARD_WIDTH + PANEL_WIDTH
HEIGHT = BOARD_HEIGHT
FPS = 60

BG_COLOR = (26, 33, 42)
GRID_COLOR = (43, 52, 63)
GRASS_COLOR = (49, 90, 58)
PANEL_BG = (20, 24, 30)

screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("Tower Defense - Day 1")
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
```

Block 2: draw functions

```python
def draw_grid():
	for row in range(GRID_ROWS):
		for col in range(GRID_COLS):
			x = col * TILE_SIZE
			y = row * TILE_SIZE
			pygame.draw.rect(screen, GRASS_COLOR, (x, y, TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE))
			pygame.draw.rect(screen, GRID_COLOR, (x, y, TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE), 1)


def draw_panel():
	pygame.draw.rect(screen, PANEL_BG, (BOARD_WIDTH, 0, PANEL_WIDTH, HEIGHT))
```

Block 3: main loop

```python
def main():
	running = True
	while running:
		clock.tick(FPS)

		for event in pygame.event.get():
			if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
				running = False

		screen.fill(BG_COLOR)
		draw_grid()
		draw_panel()
		pygame.display.flip()

	pygame.quit()
	sys.exit()


if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()
```

Test now:
- Run and verify grid draws.

## Day 2: Path and One Enemy

Checkpoint goal:
- One enemy moves through a curved path.

Block 1: path data and helper

```python
import math
from dataclasses import dataclass

PATH_COLOR = (116, 89, 68)
ENEMY_COLOR = (223, 104, 90)

PATH_TILES = [
	(0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5),
	(5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 7),
	(8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (9, 5), (10, 5),
	(11, 5), (12, 5), (12, 4), (12, 3),
	(13, 3), (14, 3), (15, 3),
]
PATH_SET = set(PATH_TILES)


def tile_center(col, row):
	return (col * TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE / 2, row * TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE / 2)


PATH_POINTS = [tile_center(c, r) for c, r in PATH_TILES]
```

Block 2: update draw_grid to paint path

```python
def draw_grid():
	for row in range(GRID_ROWS):
		for col in range(GRID_COLS):
			x = col * TILE_SIZE
			y = row * TILE_SIZE
			tile_color = PATH_COLOR if (col, row) in PATH_SET else GRASS_COLOR
			pygame.draw.rect(screen, tile_color, (x, y, TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE))
			pygame.draw.rect(screen, GRID_COLOR, (x, y, TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE), 1)
```

Block 3: Enemy class

```python
@dataclass
class Enemy:
	x: float
	y: float
	speed: float = 90.0
	path_index: int = 0

	def update(self, dt):
		if self.path_index >= len(PATH_POINTS) - 1:
			return
		tx, ty = PATH_POINTS[self.path_index + 1]
		dx = tx - self.x
		dy = ty - self.y
		dist = math.hypot(dx, dy)
		if dist < 1e-4:
			self.path_index += 1
			return

		step = self.speed * dt
		if step >= dist:
			self.x, self.y = tx, ty
			self.path_index += 1
		else:
			self.x += dx / dist * step
			self.y += dy / dist * step

	def draw(self):
		pygame.draw.circle(screen, ENEMY_COLOR, (int(self.x), int(self.y)), 14)
```

Block 4: integrate in main

```python
enemy = Enemy(*PATH_POINTS[0])

# Inside the loop, before drawing:
dt = clock.tick(FPS) / 1000.0
enemy.update(dt)

# After draw_grid():
enemy.draw()
```

Test now:
- Enemy follows path turns.

## Day 3: Wave Controller

Checkpoint goal:
- Press S to spawn a stream of enemies.

Block 1: WaveController class

```python
class WaveController:
	def __init__(self):
		self.wave_index = 0
		self.active = False
		self.spawned = 0
		self.total = 0
		self.spawn_timer = 0.0

	def begin_wave(self):
		if self.active:
			return False
		self.active = True
		self.wave_index += 1
		self.spawned = 0
		self.total = 6 + self.wave_index * 2
		self.spawn_timer = 0.2
		return True

	def update(self, dt, enemies):
		if not self.active:
			return
		self.spawn_timer -= dt
		if self.spawn_timer <= 0 and self.spawned < self.total:
			enemies.append(Enemy(*PATH_POINTS[0]))
			self.spawned += 1
			self.spawn_timer = 0.8
```

Block 2: state variables and key input

```python
enemies = []
waves = WaveController()

# In KEYDOWN events:
if event.key == pygame.K_s:
	waves.begin_wave()
```

Block 3: update/draw many enemies

```python
waves.update(dt, enemies)

for enemy in enemies:
	enemy.update(dt)

for enemy in enemies:
	enemy.draw()
```

Test now:
- S creates multiple moving enemies.

## Day 4: Tower Placement

Checkpoint goal:
- Left click places towers on valid tiles.

Block 1: Tower class

```python
TOWER_COLOR = (90, 176, 240)


@dataclass
class Tower:
	col: int
	row: int

	@property
	def x(self):
		return self.col * TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE / 2

	@property
	def y(self):
		return self.row * TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE / 2

	def draw(self):
		cx = int(self.x)
		cy = int(self.y)
		pygame.draw.rect(screen, TOWER_COLOR, (cx - 14, cy - 14, 28, 28), border_radius=4)
```

Block 2: validation helpers

```python
def tower_at(towers, col, row):
	for t in towers:
		if t.col == col and t.row == row:
			return t
	return None


def can_place_tower(towers, col, row):
	if col < 0 or col >= GRID_COLS or row < 0 or row >= GRID_ROWS:
		return False
	if (col, row) in PATH_SET:
		return False
	if tower_at(towers, col, row) is not None:
		return False
	return True
```

Block 3: mouse input

```python
towers = []

# In event loop:
if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN and event.button == 1:
	mx, my = event.pos
	if mx < BOARD_WIDTH:
		col = mx // TILE_SIZE
		row = my // TILE_SIZE
		if can_place_tower(towers, col, row):
			towers.append(Tower(col, row))
```

Block 4: draw towers

```python
for tower in towers:
	tower.draw()
```

Test now:
- Towers place on grass, not on path.

## Day 5: Bullets and Damage

Checkpoint goal:
- Towers shoot enemies and enemies can be defeated.

Block 1: extend Enemy stats

```python
# Add fields to Enemy:
health: float = 40
max_health: float = 40

# Optional health bar in Enemy.draw():
bar_w = 28
pct = max(0.0, self.health / self.max_health)
pygame.draw.rect(screen, (45, 16, 14), (int(self.x - 14), int(self.y - 22), bar_w, 5))
pygame.draw.rect(screen, (77, 201, 112), (int(self.x - 14), int(self.y - 22), int(bar_w * pct), 5))
```

Block 2: upgrade Tower behavior

```python
# Add fields to Tower:
cooldown: float = 0.0


def tower_range(tower):
	return 120


def tower_damage(tower):
	return 18


def tower_fire_rate(tower):
	return 1.0
```

Block 3: Bullet class

```python
BULLET_COLOR = (252, 210, 78)


@dataclass
class Bullet:
	x: float
	y: float
	target: Enemy
	damage: float
	speed: float = 420.0

	def update(self, dt):
		if self.target.health <= 0:
			return True
		dx = self.target.x - self.x
		dy = self.target.y - self.y
		dist = math.hypot(dx, dy)
		if dist < 8:
			self.target.health -= self.damage
			return True
		step = self.speed * dt
		self.x += dx / dist * min(step, dist)
		self.y += dy / dist * min(step, dist)
		return False

	def draw(self):
		pygame.draw.circle(screen, BULLET_COLOR, (int(self.x), int(self.y)), 4)
```

Block 4: fire logic helper

```python
def update_towers(towers, enemies, bullets, dt):
	for tower in towers:
		tower.cooldown -= dt
		if tower.cooldown > 0:
			continue

		target = None
		for enemy in enemies:
			d = math.hypot(enemy.x - tower.x, enemy.y - tower.y)
			if enemy.health > 0 and d <= tower_range(tower):
				target = enemy
				break

		if target is not None:
			bullets.append(Bullet(tower.x, tower.y, target, tower_damage(tower)))
			tower.cooldown = 1.0 / tower_fire_rate(tower)
```

Block 5: integrate bullets and death cleanup

```python
bullets = []

update_towers(towers, enemies, bullets, dt)

for b in list(bullets):
	if b.update(dt):
		bullets.remove(b)

for b in bullets:
	b.draw()

for enemy in list(enemies):
	if enemy.health <= 0:
		enemies.remove(enemy)
```

Test now:
- Towers fire and enemies disappear when defeated.

## Day 6: Gold, Lives, HUD

Checkpoint goal:
- Building costs gold, kills reward gold, leaks cost lives.

Block 1: resources and text

```python
font = pygame.font.SysFont("menlo", 20)
# Place variables below in main
gold = 220
lives = 20
tower_cost = 70
message = "Press S to start wave."
```

Block 2: charge gold for placement

```python
# In mouse place logic:
if can_place_tower(towers, col, row) and gold >= tower_cost:
	towers.append(Tower(col, row))
	gold -= tower_cost
elif gold < tower_cost:
	message = "Not enough gold."
```

Block 3: lives and rewards in enemy updates

```python
for enemy in list(enemies):
	enemy.update(dt)
	if enemy.path_index >= len(PATH_POINTS) - 1:
		enemies.remove(enemy)
		lives -= 1
		message = "Enemy leaked through!"
	elif enemy.health <= 0:
		enemies.remove(enemy)
		gold += 12
```

Block 4: HUD function

```python
def draw_hud(gold, lives, wave_num, message):
	lines = [
		f"Gold: {gold}",
		f"Lives: {lives}",
		f"Wave: {wave_num}",
		message,
	]
	y = 20
	for line in lines:
		surf = font.render(line, True, (230, 234, 240))
		screen.blit(surf, (BOARD_WIDTH + 16, y))
		y += 28
```

Block 5: call HUD

```python
draw_hud(gold, lives, waves.wave_index, message)
```

Test now:
- Gold and lives change while playing.

## Day 7: Wave Scaling

Checkpoint goal:
- Later waves are clearly harder.

Block 1: scale values in begin_wave

```python
# In WaveController.begin_wave()
self.total = 6 + self.wave_index * 3
self.enemy_health = 30 + self.wave_index * 8
self.enemy_speed = 80 + self.wave_index * 4
```

Block 2: spawn scaled enemies

```python
# In WaveController.update() spawn line:
enemies.append(
	Enemy(*PATH_POINTS[0], speed=self.enemy_speed, health=self.enemy_health, max_health=self.enemy_health)
)
```

Block 3: optional auto waves toggle

```python
# In WaveController.__init__:
self.auto_mode = False

# In keydown:
if event.key == pygame.K_a:
	waves.auto_mode = not waves.auto_mode

# In main loop:
if waves.auto_mode and not waves.active and len(enemies) == 0:
	waves.begin_wave()
```

Test now:
- Wave 3 feels stronger than wave 1.

## Day 8: Selection and Upgrade

Checkpoint goal:
- Select tower and press U to upgrade it.

Block 1: Tower level fields

```python
# Add to Tower:
level: int = 1


def tower_range(tower):
	return 120 + (tower.level - 1) * 28


def tower_damage(tower):
	return 18 + (tower.level - 1) * 12


def tower_fire_rate(tower):
	return 1.0 + (tower.level - 1) * 0.35
```

Block 2: selected tower state

```python
selected_tower = None
upgrade_cost = 90
```

Block 3: click to select existing tower

```python
clicked = tower_at(towers, col, row)
if clicked is not None:
	selected_tower = clicked
else:
	# place tower logic from previous day
	pass
```

Block 4: upgrade key

```python
if event.key == pygame.K_u and selected_tower is not None:
	if gold >= upgrade_cost and selected_tower.level < 4:
		selected_tower.level += 1
		gold -= upgrade_cost
		message = f"Tower upgraded to L{selected_tower.level}."
```

Block 5: draw selected indicator

```python
for tower in towers:
	tower.draw()
	if tower is selected_tower:
		pygame.draw.circle(screen, (255, 215, 117), (int(tower.x), int(tower.y)), int(tower_range(tower)), 2)
```

Test now:
- Selected tower improves after pressing U.

## Day 9: Win/Lose and Restart

Checkpoint goal:
- Complete game loop with end states and reset.

Block 1: state values

```python
game_state = "playing"
total_waves = 12
```

Block 2: set lose condition

```python
if lives <= 0:
	game_state = "lose"
	message = "Defeat. Press R to restart."
```

Block 3: set win condition

```python
if waves.wave_index >= total_waves and not waves.active and len(enemies) == 0:
	game_state = "win"
	message = "Victory. Press R to restart."
```

Block 4: overlay function

```python
def draw_overlay(game_state):
	if game_state == "playing":
		return
	overlay = pygame.Surface((BOARD_WIDTH, BOARD_HEIGHT), pygame.SRCALPHA)
	overlay.fill((7, 10, 14, 170))
	screen.blit(overlay, (0, 0))

	title = "Victory" if game_state == "win" else "Defeat"
	t = font.render(title, True, (230, 234, 240))
	p = font.render("Press R to play again", True, (230, 234, 240))
	screen.blit(t, (BOARD_WIDTH // 2 - 40, BOARD_HEIGHT // 2 - 30))
	screen.blit(p, (BOARD_WIDTH // 2 - 120, BOARD_HEIGHT // 2 + 5))
```

Block 5: reset helper

```python
def reset_game_state():
	return {
		"gold": 220,
		"lives": 20,
		"message": "Press S to start wave.",
		"game_state": "playing",
		"towers": [],
		"selected_tower": None,
		"enemies": [],
		"bullets": [],
		"waves": WaveController(),
	}
```

Block 6: restart input

```python
if event.key == pygame.K_r:
	state = reset_game_state()
	gold = state["gold"]
	lives = state["lives"]
	message = state["message"]
	game_state = state["game_state"]
	towers = state["towers"]
	selected_tower = state["selected_tower"]
	enemies = state["enemies"]
	bullets = state["bullets"]
	waves = state["waves"]
```

Test now:
- Win/lose screens appear and R fully restarts.

## Day 10: Polish Day (No Full Solution Drop)

Checkpoint goal:
- Each student adds one feature and demos it.

Choose one feature block to implement:
- Add a new tower type function.
- Add a fast enemy subclass.
- Add sound effects function.
- Add pause toggle function.
- Add score tracking function.

Teacher rule:
- Students must explain where their function is called and why.

## Debug Checklist

If game crashes:
- Fix the first error shown in terminal.
- Verify every function call has matching parameters.

If nothing draws:
- Confirm screen.fill, draw calls, and pygame.display.flip all run each frame.

If towers do not shoot:
- Verify update_towers is called every loop.
- Verify cooldown goes down with dt.

If restart breaks:
- Verify every game list and counter is reset.

## Daily Exit Ticket Prompt

Use this every day:
1. What function or class did you add today?
2. What test proved it worked?
3. What bug did you fix?
